> Angular CLI builder that runs your application in the desktop using Electron

The builder runs your Angular application in `serve` mode and loads it in an Electron window. Notice that the builder currently assumes that you are serving your application on the default port 4200.

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/bampakoa/ngx-electronify)

## Install

```sh
ng add ngx-electronify
```
You can pass the following options:
* `--project`: the name of the project on which you want to install it. It is useful in multi-project workspaces such as Nx DevTools.
* `--configuration`: the configuration of the workspace. By default it uses the development configuration.

## Usage

```sh
ng run [project-name]:desktop
```
